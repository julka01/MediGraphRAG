PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

European Association of Urology Guidelines on Prostate Cancer

1. INTRODUCTION TO PROSTATE CANCER
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignant neoplasm that originates in the prostate gland.
It is the second most common cancer in males worldwide and the most common non-dermatological malignancy in men.

2. RISK FACTORS
- Advanced age: Prostate cancer risk increases significantly with age
- Ethnicity: African-American men have higher incidence rates
- Family history: Men with a family history of prostate cancer
- Genetic predisposition: BRCA2 and other germline mutations

3. DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS
- Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) testing
- Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)
- Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI)
- Prostate biopsy guided by MRI

4. GRADING AND STAGING
ISUP Grade Groups:
- Grade Group 1: Gleason score â‰¤6
- Grade Group 2: Gleason score 3+4=7
- Grade Group 3: Gleason score 4+3=7
- Grade Group 4: Gleason score 4+4=8 or 3+5=8
- Grade Group 5: Gleason score 9-10

TNM Staging System:
- T1: Clinically undetectable
- T2: Confined to prostate
- T3: Extracapsular extension
- T4: Invasion of adjacent structures

5. TREATMENT APPROACHES
Active Surveillance:
- Recommended for low-risk disease
- Regular PSA monitoring
- Repeat biopsies for progression

Active Treatment Options:
- Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical removal
- Radiation Therapy: External beam or brachytherapy
- Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)
- Focal Therapy: Emerging approaches

6. DISEASE PROGRESSION
- Lymph node metastasis
- Bone metastasis
- Visceral metastasis
- Hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPCa)

7. CLINICAL TRIALS AND RESEARCH
- Immunotherapy approaches
- Novel androgen receptor antagonists
- Targeted molecular therapies
- Angiogenesis inhibitors
- Radium-223 for bone metastases

8. PATIENT MANAGEMENT
- Shared decision making
- Quality of life assessment
- Geriatric assessment for elderly patients
- Supportive care and palliative approaches
- Long-term follow-up protocols

Key Relationships:
1. Prostate cancer -> Age (risk factor)
2. Prostate cancer -> Prostate Specific Antigen (diagnostic marker)
3. Prostate cancer -> Gleason Score (grading)
4. Prostate cancer -> TNM Staging (staging)
5. Prostate cancer -> Radical Prostatectomy (treatment)
6. Prostate cancer -> Radiation Therapy (treatment)
7. Prostate cancer -> Androgen Deprivation Therapy (treatment)
8. Prostate cancer -> Metastasizes to bone (advancing disease)
9. Prostate cancer -> Hormone-sensitive (subtype)
10. Prostate cancer -> Hormone-resistant (advanced subtype)

Additional Medical Entities:
- Adenocarcinoma: Primary histology type
- Basal cell carcinoma: Rare prostate cancer type
- Ductal carcinoma: Aggressive variant
- Neuroendocrine tumor: Rare prostate cancer type

Diagnostic Criteria:
- PSA > 4.0 ng/mL: warrants further investigation
- PSA density > 0.15 ng/g: concerning for cancer
- Free PSA < 10%: increased risk
- PSA velocity > 0.75 ng/mL/year: concerning

Treatment Complications:
- Urinary incontinence (from surgery)
- Erectile dysfunction (from surgery/radiation)
- Bowel toxicity (from radiation)
- Hot flashes (from hormonal therapy)
- Osteoporosis (from ADT)
- Cardiovascular events (from ADT)
