# Multi-Hop Reasoning Framework for RAG

## Core Principles
1. Decompose complex queries into atomic reasoning steps
2. Establish clear inference chains
3. Validate each reasoning hop
4. Maintain context and knowledge graph relationships

## Reasoning Hop Structure

### Hop 1: Query Decomposition
- Break down complex query into core components
- Identify key entities and relationships
- Extract relevant knowledge graph nodes

### Hop 2: Context Retrieval
- Fetch relevant context from knowledge graph
- Score and rank contextual information
- Establish initial inference potential

### Hop 3: Inference Generation
- Create hypotheses based on retrieved context
- Apply domain-specific reasoning rules
- Validate against knowledge graph constraints

### Hop 4: Cross-Validation
- Compare generated inferences
- Check for consistency across reasoning paths
- Resolve potential contradictions

### Hop 5: Confidence Scoring
- Quantify reasoning reliability
- Assess evidence strength
- Determine inference credibility

## Reasoning Quality Metrics
- Semantic coherence
- Contextual relevance
- Logical consistency
- Evidential support

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use probabilistic reasoning techniques
- Implement dynamic hop adjustment
- Maintain transparent reasoning trails
- Enable explainable AI principles

## Example Reasoning Flow
```python
def multi_hop_reasoning(query, knowledge_graph):
    # Hop 1: Decompose Query
    query_components = decompose_query(query)
    
    # Hop 2: Retrieve Context
    contexts = retrieve_contexts(query_components, knowledge_graph)
    
    # Hop 3: Generate Inferences
    inferences = generate_inferences(contexts)
    
    # Hop 4: Cross-Validate
    validated_inferences = cross_validate_inferences(inferences)
    
    # Hop 5: Score Confidence
    confidence_score = calculate_confidence(validated_inferences)
    
    return {
        "conclusion": select_best_inference(validated_inferences),
        "confidence": confidence_score,
        "reasoning_steps": validated_inferences
    }
```

## Confidence Levels
- **High**: Strong, multi-source evidence
- **Medium**: Moderate supporting evidence
- **Low**: Limited or conflicting evidence

## Error Handling
- Graceful fallback mechanisms
- Transparent uncertainty communication
- Contextual error explanations
