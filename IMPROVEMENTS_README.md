# Knowledge Graph Creation Backend Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the KG creation backend, focusing on enhanced prompting, better ontology integration, and more accurate biomedical knowledge graph generation.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Biomedical Ontology

**File:** `biomedical_ontology.owl`

- **Comprehensive Node Types:** 15 specialized biomedical entity types including:
  - Disease, Treatment, Medication, Procedure, Symptom
  - Biomarker, AnatomicalStructure, RiskFactor, Stage
  - Gene, Protein, Pathway, ClinicalTrial, Guideline, Organization

- **Rich Relationship Types:** 19 medically relevant relationship types:
  - TREATS, CAUSES, SYMPTOM_OF, BIOMARKER_FOR
  - AFFECTS, HAS_STAGE, DIAGNOSES, DETECTS
  - PRODUCES, ENCODES, GENETIC_RISK_FACTOR
  - RECOMMENDS, STUDIES, PUBLISHED_BY, etc.

### 2. Improved KG Creator

**File:** `improved_kg_creator.py`

#### Key Features:
- **Ontology-Driven Extraction:** Strictly follows biomedical ontology constraints
- **Enhanced Prompting:** Specialized biomedical knowledge extraction prompts
- **Intelligent Validation:** Automatic label and relationship type validation
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- **Property Enrichment:** Extracts clinical properties like evidence levels, stages, etc.

#### Core Methods:
```python
class ImprovedKGCreator:
    def generate_knowledge_graph(text, llm, ontology=None, max_text_length=4000)
    def parse_owl_ontology_from_file(owl_file_path)
    def parse_owl_ontology_from_bytes(owl_bytes)
    def _validate_and_clean_kg(kg_data, ontology)
    def _find_closest_label(label, valid_labels)
    def _find_closest_relationship(rel_type, valid_relationships)
```

### 3. Enhanced Prompting System

#### Biomedical-Specific Guidelines:
1. **Entity Identification:** Clear categorization of medical entities
2. **Relationship Extraction:** Medically accurate relationship mapping
3. **Property Enrichment:** Clinical metadata extraction
4. **Quality Requirements:** Minimum node/relationship thresholds
5. **Ontology Compliance:** Strict adherence to provided ontology

#### Sample Prompt Structure:
```
ONTOLOGY CONSTRAINTS:
- Node Labels (MUST use only these): Disease, Treatment, Medication, ...
- Relationship Types (MUST use only these): TREATS, CAUSES, SYMPTOM_OF, ...

EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
1. ENTITY IDENTIFICATION: [detailed medical entity types]
2. RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION: [medical relationship patterns]
3. PROPERTY ENRICHMENT: [clinical properties to extract]
4. QUALITY REQUIREMENTS: [minimum standards]
5. JSON STRUCTURE: [exact format specification]
```

### 4. Integration with Main Application

**File:** `app.py` (Updated)

- **Seamless Integration:** ImprovedKGCreator integrated into existing API endpoints
- **Fallback Support:** Graceful degradation to original system if needed
- **Ontology Loading:** Automatic biomedical ontology loading
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Better error reporting and recovery

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

**File:** `test_improved_kg.py`

#### Test Coverage:
1. **Ontology Loading Test:** Verifies biomedical ontology loads correctly
2. **OWL Parsing Test:** Tests OWL file parsing functionality
3. **Ontology Validation Test:** Validates label and relationship matching
4. **KG Generation Test:** End-to-end knowledge graph creation test

#### Test Results:
```
âœ… Ontology loading: PASSED (15 node labels, 19 relationship types)
âœ… OWL parsing: PASSED
âœ… Ontology validation: PASSED
âœ… KG generation: PASSED (with fallback support)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage:
```python
from improved_kg_creator import ImprovedKGCreator
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

creator = ImprovedKGCreator()
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")

kg = creator.generate_knowledge_graph(
    text="Clinical text here...",
    llm=llm,
    ontology=None,  # Uses default biomedical ontology
    max_text_length=4000
)
```

### Custom Ontology Usage:
```python
# Load custom ontology
custom_ontology = creator.parse_owl_ontology_from_file("custom.owl")

kg = creator.generate_knowledge_graph(
    text="Clinical text here...",
    llm=llm,
    ontology=custom_ontology
)
