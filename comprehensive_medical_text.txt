Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in the prostate gland. It is one of the most common cancers affecting men worldwide. The prostate is a small walnut-shaped gland located below the bladder that produces seminal fluid.

Risk factors for prostate cancer include age, family history, and race. Men over 50 are at higher risk, and African American men have the highest incidence rates. Genetic factors also play a role, with mutations in genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2 increasing susceptibility.

Symptoms of prostate cancer may include frequent urination, difficulty urinating, blood in urine or semen, and erectile dysfunction. However, early-stage prostate cancer often presents no symptoms, making regular screening important.

Diagnosis typically involves PSA testing, digital rectal examination, and prostate biopsy. Imaging studies like MRI and CT scans help determine the extent of the disease. Gleason scoring classifies the aggressiveness of the cancer cells.

Treatment options for prostate cancer include active surveillance for low-risk cases, surgery (radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. The choice of treatment depends on the stage, grade, and patient's overall health.

Common drugs used in prostate cancer treatment include:
- Docetaxel (chemotherapy agent)
- Abiraterone (hormone therapy)
- Enzalutamide (anti-androgen therapy)
- Sipuleucel-T (immunotherapy vaccine)

Side effects of treatment may include urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and hot flashes. Supportive care and rehabilitation are important aspects of prostate cancer management.

Survival rates for prostate cancer are generally high, especially when detected early. The 5-year survival rate for localized prostate cancer exceeds 98%. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential for long-term management.
